# Computer programs of the PhD thesis "Influence of roughness on the dynamical properties of granular gases"
Here, some Python-based computer programs developed in the PhD thesis entitled "Influence of roughness on the dynamical properties of granular gases", by Alberto Meg√≠as, are shown.

In the folder EDMD there is a library of routines created for running whatever EDMD algorithm of the thesis. On the other hand, in the folder DSMC, there are three examples of DSMC programs used in the thesis, which can be easily adapted to other setups.
